# Disease-Outbreak-Simulation
## Simulation of a disease based on OOP

Created using python. It simulates the spread of a communicable infectious disease through the population. Both, an individual and whole populationâ€™s attributes are modelled using classes.
We can set various initial conditions like size of population, rate of infection, mortality rate, infection duration. We can also select the number of days; we want the simulation to run.
The interaction of people in the population and spread of infection get simulated. For each day of the simulation, we get details of the spread of disease.
At the end of the simulation, we get the timeline of the infected and deaths in graph format.
